# PgBouncer exporter

Prometheus exporter for PgBouncer.
Exports metrics at `localhost:56790/metrics`

## Building and running
Build the binary
```
$make build
```
Export PgBouncer admin password using environment variable
```
$export PGPASSWORD=kubedb123
```
Run the binary
```
$./pgbouncer_exporter <flags>
```
Available configuration flags:
```shell
- pgBouncer.connectionString: Connection string for accessing pgBouncer. The default is "postgres://postgres:@localhost:6543/pgbouncer?sslmode=disable". Connection string Can also be set using environment variable DATA_SOURCE_NAME.
- version: Print version information.
- web.listen-address: Address on which to expose metrics and web interface. (default ":56790")
- web.telemetry-path: Path under which to expose metrics. (default "/metrics")
```
To see all available configuration flags:

    ./pgbouncer_exporter -h
Setting password and connection string is the minimum requirement to collect stats from a specific PgBouncer server.

##Docker Image

## Metrics

Metric | Description
-------|------------
config_application_name_add_host | Whether pgbouncer add the client host address and port to the application name setting set on connection start or not
config_autodb_idle_timeout | Unused pools created via '*' are reclaimed after this interval
config_client_idle_timeout | Client connections idling longer than this many seconds are closed
config_client_login_timeout | Maximum time in seconds for a client to either login, or be disconnected
config_default_pool_size | The default for how many server connections to allow per user/database pair
config_disable_pqexec | Boolean; 1 means pgbouncer enforce Simple Query Protocol; 0 means it allows multiple queries in a single packet
config_dns_max_ttl | Irregardless of DNS TTL, this is the TTL that pgbouncer enforces for dns lookups it does for backends
config_dns_nxdomain_ttl | Irregardless of DNS TTL, this is the period enforced for negative DNS answers
config_dns_zone_check_period | Period to check if zone serial has changed.
config_idle_transaction_timeout | If client has been in 'idle in transaction' state longer than this amount in seconds, it will be disconnected.
config_listen_backlog | Maximum number of backlogged listen connections before further connection attempts are dropped
config_log_connections | Whether connections are logged or not.
config_log_disconnections | Whether connection disconnects are logged.
config_log_pooler_errors | Whether pooler errors are logged or not
config_max_client_conn | Maximum number of client connections allowed
config_max_db_connections | Server level maximum connections enforced for a given db, irregardless of pool limits
config_max_packet_size | Maximum packet size for postgresql packets that pgbouncer will relay to backends
config_max_user_connections | Maximum number of connections a user can open irregardless of pool limits
config_min_pool_size | Mininum number of backends a pool will always retain.
config_pkt_buf | Internal buffer size for packets.  See docs
config_query_timeout | Maximum time that a query can run for before being cancelled.
config_query_wait_timeout | Maximum time that a query can wait to be executed before being cancelled.
config_reserve_pool_size | How many additional connections to allow to a pool once it's crossed it's maximum
config_reserve_pool_timeout | If a client has not been serviced in this many seconds, pgbouncer enables use of additional connections from reserve pool.
config_sbuf_loopcnt | How many results to process for a given connection's packet results before switching to others to ensure fairness.  See docs.
config_server_check_delay | How long to keep released connections available for immediate re-use, without running sanity-check queries on it. If 0 then the query is ran always.
config_server_connect_timeout | Maximum time allowed for connecting and logging into a backend server
config_server_idle_timeout | If a server connection has been idle more than this many seconds it will be dropped
config_server_lifetime | The pooler will close an unused server connection that has been connected longer than this many seconds
config_server_login_retry | If connecting to a backend failed, this is the wait interval in seconds before retrying
config_server_reset_query_always | Boolean indicating whether or not server_reset_query is enforced for all pooling modes, or just session
config_server_round_robin | Boolean; if 1, pgbouncer uses backends in a round robin fashion.  If 0, it uses LIFO to minimize connectivity to backends
config_stats_period | Periodicity in seconds of pgbouncer recalculating internal stats_

config_tcpkeepalive | Boolean; if 1, tcp keepalive is enabled w/ OS defaults.  If 0, disabled.
config_verbose | If log verbosity is increased.  Only relevant as a metric if log volume begins exceeding log consumption
databases_current_connections | Current number of client connections
databases_disabled | Boolean indicating whether a pgbouncer DISABLE is currently active for this database
databases_max_connections | Maximum number of client connections allowed
databases_paused | Boolean indicating whether a pgbouncer PAUSE is currently active for this database
